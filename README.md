 **AstraKairos is an integrated scientific framework to find the *kairos*â€”the opportune momentâ€”for astronomical discovery. From validating binary star orbits to planning variable star photometry.**

This open-source Python suite bridges the gap between massive astronomical catalogs (like Gaia, WDS, and ORB6) and practical night-to-night observation, enabling researchers and amateur astronomers to find and prioritize the most scientifically valuable targets.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Observation Planner (GUI):** A user-friendly desktop application that recommends the optimal sky region for observation by analyzing local conditions, moon position, and zenith.
- **Physicality Validation Engine:** Uses high-precision data from the Gaia satellite to definitively confirm whether a star pair is a true physical binary or just an optical illusion.
- **Orbital Prediction & Deviation Analysis:** Implements a robust Kepler's equation solver to predict the positions of stars in known orbits and identifies systems whose published orbits are outdated or incorrect.
- **Data-Driven Target Prioritization:** Analyzes catalogs to identify scientifically interesting targets, such as high-velocity systems or neglected historical binaries.
- **Modular Data Sources:** Can operate using local, offline catalogs (for performance and reproducibility) or by scraping up-to-date web sources.

## Installation

AstraKairos is designed to be easily installed via pip.

```bash
# It is recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

pip install astrakairos
```

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AstraKairos/astrakairos.git
```

## Quickstart

AstraKairos provides two main entry points: a graphical planner and a command-line analyzer.

### 1. Launch the Observation Planner (GUI)

After installation, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
astrakairos-plan
```

### 2. Run the Data Analyzer (CLI)

The analyzer can process a CSV list of stars. For example, to analyze the top 10 stars from `targets.csv` using the web data source:

```bash
astrakairos-analyze targets.csv --source web --limit 10
```

For more details, run `astrakairos-analyze --help`.

## ðŸš€ Feature Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features for the AstroKairos suite. The development is phased to deliver a robust and scientifically valuable tool at each stage.

### v1.0: The Binary Star Research Suite

*The primary goal of v1.0 is to be the world's most comprehensive open-source tool for the validation, planning, analysis, and visualization of visual double stars.*

- [ ] **Centralized Catalog Hub:**
    - [ ] Implement a `CatalogHub` to query and cross-match data from WDS, ORB6, and external services.
    - [ ] Integrate **SIMBAD** name resolution (via `astroquery`) to find objects by common names (e.g., "Sirius").

**Scientific Engine (`physics` module)**
- [x] **Kepler's Equation Solver:** Implement a high-precision, robust numerical solver by using an advanced initial guess combined with a fast Newton-Raphson refiner.
- [ ] **Orbital Prediction Engine:**
    - [ ] Predict precise ephemerides (PA/Sep) for any date from known orbital elements.
    - [ ] Calculate all orbital anomalies (Mean, Eccentric, True) for analysis.
- [ ] **Physicality & Dynamics Analysis:**
    - [ ] Implement a **Gaia Validator** to confirm or refute physical companionship using parallax and proper motion data.
    - [ ] Implement a **Velocity Vector Analyzer** to calculate apparent motion (`v_total`) and its direction (`PA_v`) from historical data.
    - [ ] Implement a **Dynamic Mass Calculator** to derive total system mass using Kepler's Third Law and Gaia parallaxes.

**User Interfaces & Workflow**
- [ ] **Graphical Planner (GUI - `astrakairos-plan`):**
    - [x] Location Management: Search and select observatories from a built-in JSON database.
    - [x] **Local Conditions Engine:**
        - [x] Calculate precise times for sunset, sunrise, and all three twilights (Civil, Nautical, Astronomical).
        - [x] Compute Moon phase, rise/set times, and position/visibility throughout the night.
    - [x] **"Kairos" Recommender:**
        - [x] Implement the "Optimal Sky Region" calculation (anti-moon/zenith strategy).
    - [ ] **Integrated Workflow:**
        - [ ] Add a pipeline to generate and display a list of high-priority targets directly in the GUI based on the optimal region.
        - [ ] Generate pre-filled search URLs for external databases like Stelle Doppie.
- [ ] **Command-Line Analyzer (CLI - `astrakairos-analyze`):**
    - [x] Process star lists in batch from CSV files.
    - [x] Implement robust command-line argument parsing (`argparse`).
    - [ ] Allow user selection of data source (`local` vs. `web`).
    - [ ] Generate comprehensive analysis reports for each target, including physicality, orbital deviation, mass, etc.
    - [ ] Export detailed, structured results to a new CSV file for further analysis.

**Essential Utilities**

**AstraKairos is an integrated framework to find the *kairos*â€”the opportune momentâ€”for astronomical discovery. v1.0 focuses on Binary Stars projects by presenting several QOL-improving as well as analysis tools. This open-source Python suite bridges the gap between massive astronomical catalogs (Such as the WDS, WDSS, and the ORB6) and practical night-to-night observation.**

AstraKairos brings researchers and amateur astronomers modern tools to identify, prioritize, and analyze targets in the Binary Stars realm.

## Key Features (v1.0)

### ðŸ”­ **Observation Planner (GUI)**
A desktop application that optimizes astronomical observations by analyzing:
- **Location-aware calculations:** Over 3,000+ observatory locations worldwide  
- **Twilight calculations:** Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight times with timezone support
- **Sky quality mapping:** Atmospheric extinction and lunar contamination models
- **Target search generation:** Filtering with 18 search methods based on [Stelle Doppie](https://www.stelledoppie.it/)'s searching tool
- **CSV import & analysis:** Parsing of downloaded Stelle Doppie's data with format auto-detection
- **Multi-platform compatibility:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions

### ðŸš€ **Velocity Analysis Engine** 
- **Binary velocity calculation:** Calculates total observed angular velocity for imported results from Stelle Doppie
- **Endpoint velocity calculations:** Uses first/last observation epochs for motion analysis
- **Velocity statistics:** Statistics and high-priority target identification
- **Column mapping:** Handles both basic and full CSV formats from Stelle Doppie

### ðŸŒ™ **Astronomical Calculations**
- **Precise ephemeris:** Powered by Skyfield with JPL DE421 ephemeris data
- **Sky brightness modeling:** Krisciunas & Schaefer (1991) lunar scattering implementation
- **Atmospheric extinction:** Site-specific extinction coefficients for photometry
- **Time-domain optimization:** Finds optimal observing windows considering environmental factors

### ðŸ“Š **Data-Driven Target Prioritization (CLI)**
A command-line tool that analyzes star catalogs to find high-priority targets:
- **Apparent Motion Vectors:** Identifies high-velocity systems with significant relative motion
- **Observation Priority Index (OPI):** Metric quantifying orbital deviation urgency
- **Physicality Validation:** Uses Gaia DR3 data to distinguish physical binaries from optical alignments

### ðŸ”§ **Data Handling**
- **Multiple export formats:** CSV, JSON, LaTeX tables with metadata
- **File processing:** Handles various encodings and CSV formats with error handling
- **Modular data sources:** Local catalogs (WDS, ORB6) or real-time web scraping
- **Orbital Prediction Engine:** Implements Kepler's equation solver to predict future positions of stars in known orbits
- **Modular Data Sources:** Can operate using local, offline catalogs (for performance and reproducibility) or by scraping up-to-date web sources

## Installation

AstraKairos requires Python 3.8+ and is designed for easy installation. A virtual environment is recommended.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:   .\venv\Scripts\activate  
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install from the repository
pip install git+https://github.com/AstraKairos/astrakairos.git

# Or install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/AstraKairos/astrakairos.git
cd astrakairos
pip install -e .
```

**Dependencies automatically installed:**
- `skyfield` - High-precision astronomical calculations
- `pandas` - Data analysis and CSV processing
- `astropy` - Astronomical data structures and utilities
- `astroquery` - Access to astronomical databases  
- `pytz` - Timezone calculations
- `numpy`, `scipy` - Numerical computations

**First-time setup:** On first run, Skyfield will automatically download the JPL DE421 ephemeris file (~17MB) for precise planetary positions.

## Usage

AstraKairos provides two main entry points: a graphical planner and a command-line analyzer.

### 1. Observation Planner (GUI)

Launch the observation planning interface:

```bash
python main.py planner
```

The GUI provides:
- **Observatory selection** from 3,000+ worldwide locations
- **Optimal sky region calculation** using atmospheric models  
- **Stelle Doppie search generation** with 18 filtering methods
- **CSV data import & analysis** with automatic format detection
- **Velocity analysis** for identifying high-motion binary systems
- **Export capabilities** in multiple formats

### 2. Data Analyzer (CLI)

Process star catalogs to find high-priority observation targets:

```bash
python main.py analyzer targets.csv --source web --mode discovery --limit 10 --sort-by velocity
```

For analysis with local catalogs:
```bash
python main.py analyzer targets.csv --source local --wds-file wds.txt --orb6-file orb6.txt --mode orbital --validate-gaia
```

**Analysis modes:**
- `discovery`: Motion analysis and velocity calculations
- `characterize`: Orbital fitting and parameter estimation  
- `orbital`: OPI calculation for observation priority ranking

For complete CLI documentation:
```bash
python main.py analyzer --help
```

**AstraKairos is an integrated framework to find the *kairos*â€”the opportune momentâ€”for astronomical discovery. v1.0 focuses on Binary Stars projects by presenting several QOL-improving as well as analysis tools. This open-source Python suite bridges the gap between massive astronomical catalogs (Such as the WDS, WDSS, and the ORB6) and practical night-to-night observation.**

AstraKairos brings researchers and amateur astronomers modern tools to identify, prioritize, and analyze targets in the Binary Stars realm.

## Key Features (v1.0)

### ðŸ”­ **Observation Planner (GUI)**
A desktop application that optimizes astronomical observations by analyzing:
- **Location-aware calculations:** Over 3,000+ observatory locations worldwide  
- **Twilight calculations:** Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight times with timezone support
- **Sky quality mapping:** Atmospheric extinction and lunar contamination models
- **Target search generation:** Filtering with 18 search methods based on [Stelle Doppie](https://www.stelledoppie.it/)'s searching tool
- **CSV import & analysis:** Parsing of downloaded Stelle Doppie's data with format auto-detection
- **Multi-platform compatibility:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions

### ðŸš€ **Velocity Analysis Engine**

### ðŸ“Š **Data-Driven Target Prioritization (CLI)**
A command-line tool that analyzes star catalogs to find high-priority targets:
- **Apparent Motion Vectors:** Identifies high-velocity systems with significant relative motion
- **Observation Priority Index (OPI):** Metric quantifying orbital deviation urgency
- **Physicality Validation:** Uses Gaia DR3 data to distinguish physical binaries from optical alignments

### ðŸ”§ **Data Handling**

- **Orbital Prediction Engine:** Implements Kepler's equation solver to predict future positions of stars in known orbits
- **Modular Data Sources:** Can operate using local, offline catalogs (for performance and reproducibility) or by scraping up-to-date web sources

## Installation

AstraKairos requires Python 3.8+ and is designed for easy installation. A virtual environment is recommended.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:   .\venv\Scripts\activate  
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install from the repository
pip install git+https://github.com/AstraKairos/astrakairos.git

# Or install in development mode
git clone https://github.com/AstraKairos/astrakairos.git
cd astrakairos
pip install -e .
```

**Dependencies automatically installed:**
- `skyfield` - High-precision astronomical calculations
- `pandas` - Data analysis and CSV processing
- `astropy` - Astronomical data structures and utilities
- `astroquery` - Access to astronomical databases  
- `pytz` - Timezone calculations
- `numpy`, `scipy` - Numerical computations

**First-time setup:** On first run, Skyfield will automatically download the JPL DE421 ephemeris file (~17MB) for precise planetary positions.

## Usage

AstraKairos provides two main entry points: a graphical planner and a command-line analyzer.

### 1. Observation Planner (GUI)

Launch the observation planning interface:

```bash
python main.py planner
```

The GUI provides:
- **Observatory selection** from 3,000+ worldwide locations
- **Optimal sky region calculation** using atmospheric models  
- **Stelle Doppie search generation** with 18 filtering methods
- **CSV data import & analysis** with automatic format detection
- **Velocity analysis** for identifying high-motion binary systems
- **Export capabilities** in multiple formats

### 2. Data Analyzer (CLI)

The CLI analyzer processes binary star catalogs to find high-priority observation targets. It requires a **SQLite database** created from WDSS/ORB6 catalogs using the conversion script.

#### **Prerequisites**

First, create the SQLite database from your catalog files:
```bash
# Convert WDSS and ORB6 catalogs to SQLite database
python scripts/convert_catalogs_to_sqlite.py --wdss-file wdss_master.txt --orb6-file orb6_catalog.txt --output catalogs.db
```

You only need to do this once. The required catalog files are:
- **WDSS Master Catalog** (`wdss_master.txt`) - Binary star measurements
- **ORB6 Catalog** (`orb6_catalog.txt`) - Orbital elements for known binaries

#### **Two Analysis Modes**

**Option A: Analyze ALL systems in database (recommended for discovery)**
```bash
# Discover high-motion systems from entire database
python -m astrakairos.analyzer.cli --all --database-path catalogs.db --limit 100

# Find orbital priority targets with Gaia validation
python -m astrakairos.analyzer.cli --all --database-path catalogs.db --mode orbital --validate-gaia --limit 50 --output high_priority.csv

# Characterize motion of all systems with robust fitting
python -m astrakairos.analyzer.cli --all --database-path catalogs.db --mode characterize --limit 200
```

**Option B: Analyze specific targets from a CSV file**
```bash
# Create a targets file with specific WDS IDs
echo "wds_id" > my_targets.csv
echo "00003+1154" >> my_targets.csv
echo "00005+1259" >> my_targets.csv
echo "00006+2012" >> my_targets.csv

# Analyze only these specific systems
python -m astrakairos.analyzer.cli my_targets.csv --database-path catalogs.db --mode orbital --validate-gaia
```

#### **Analysis Modes**
- **`discovery`** (default): Fast motion analysis using endpoint velocities - ideal for finding high-velocity systems
- **`characterize`**: Robust linear fitting with Theil-Sen regression - provides detailed motion characterization  
- **`orbital`**: Observation Priority Index (OPI) calculation - ranks systems by orbital deviation urgency

#### **Key Options**
- `--all`: Analyze all systems in database (alternative to providing CSV file)
- `--database-path`: **Required** - Path to SQLite database created by conversion script
- `--validate-gaia`: Enable Gaia DR3 physicality validation (requires internet connection)
- `--mode`: Analysis type (discovery/characterize/orbital)
- `--limit`: Maximum number of systems to process (recommended for large databases)
- `--output`: Save results to CSV file
- `--sort-by`: Custom sorting field (e.g., `v_total_arcsec_yr`, `opi_arcsec_yr`)

#### **Example Output**
```
TOP 10 ANALYSIS RESULTS - ORBITAL MODE (sorted by opi_arcsec_yr)
================================================================================
 1. 07142+2357           | OPI = 12.4567               | Gaia: Likely Physical
 2. 15234+4021           | OPI = 8.9123                | Gaia: Likely Physical
 3. 23456+1234           | OPI = 6.7890                | Gaia: Ambiguous
```

#### **Complete Documentation**
```bash
python -m astrakairos.analyzer.cli --help
```

#### **Setup: Generating the Required Database**

Before using the CLI, you need to create the SQLite database from the catalog files:

```bash
# Convert WDSS and ORB6 catalogs to SQLite format
python scripts/convert_catalogs_to_sqlite.py

# This creates: results/wdss3-data.db (used by the CLI)
```

**Required catalog files:**
- `data_catalogs/wdss*.txt` (WDSS catalog files)
- `data_catalogs/orb6orbits.txt` (ORB6 orbital elements)

These are included in the repository and only need to be converted once.

#### **Input File Requirements**

**Required files:**
- **SQLite database** (`catalogs.db`) - Created once from WDSS/ORB6 catalogs using the conversion script

**Optional files:**
- **Targets CSV** (`my_targets.csv`) - Used only when analyzing specific systems instead of the entire database

**Targets CSV format (when using Option B):**
```csv
wds_id
00003+1154
00005+1259
00006+2012
20126+4003
```

The CSV must contain a `wds_id` column with valid WDS designations. You can create this file:
- Manually (as shown above)
- By exporting from the GUI planner
- By filtering results from previous analyses
- From any astronomical database that provides WDS identifiers
